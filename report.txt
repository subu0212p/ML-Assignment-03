In this assignment, I built a complete sentiment analysis pipeline using Hugging Faceâ€™s transformers and datasets libraries. The goal was to classify IMDb movie reviews as positive or negative using a fine-tuned BERT model.

I started by loading the IMDb dataset using load_dataset, then used the bert-base-uncased tokenizer to preprocess the reviews by truncating and padding them appropriately. After tokenization, I fine-tuned a pre-trained BertForSequenceClassification model on a subset of the training data for efficiency.

The model was trained using the Trainer API, which simplified training and evaluation. I defined evaluation metrics like accuracy and F1-score using Scikit-learn. After training, the model was saved locally and loaded again to perform inference on new text inputs.

This pipeline is modular and easy to extend. One challenge was managing the memory and compute requirements of BERT models. To address this, I used a smaller subset of data and reduced the number of training epochs. For large-scale usage, better hardware like GPUs and gradient checkpointing would be helpful.
